Rust wrapper crate for the host library
=======================================

Description
-----------

This folder contains a Rust crate that wraps the host library generated by
the scripts in the `alveo` folder, allowing it to be used by the Rust webserver
in the `server` directory.

Dependencies
------------

 - Rust stable.
 - The host library must be built in the `alveo` directory; run `make host` in
   that directory after satisfying the dependencies listed in the `alveo`
   directory readme file.

Usage
-----

You can build the crate in this directory using `cargo` if you like. You don't
have to, though; `cargo` will automatically build it when you build or run the
server.
