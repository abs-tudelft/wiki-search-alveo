# Fletcher + Alveo demo

This demo does dynamic pattern matching in Snappy-compressed string data
stored within an Arrow table. A Scala program is available to generate the
data for this demo from Wikipedia database dumps.

## Dependencies

The tools in this repo expect the following repositories to be checked out
in the parent directory, next to this one:

 - [fletcher](https://github.com/abs-tudelft/fletcher)
 - [vhsnunzip](https://github.com/abs-tudelft/vhsnunzip)

The following Python 3 packages need to be installed:

 - [vhdeps](https://github.com/abs-tudelft/vhdeps)
 - [vhdmmio](https://github.com/abs-tudelft/vhdmmio)

## Directory structure

 - `data`: contains the Scala sources to do data preparation.
 - `hardware`: contains the VHDL code for the decompress + matching
   kernel. Some of this is pre-generated by Fletcher based on the
   `*.as` schema definitions and by `vhdmmio` based on the YAML
   files.
 - `alveo`: contains build scripts for Alveo. The scripts are based
   on the [vadd](https://github.com/Xilinx/SDAccel_Examples/tree/master/getting_started/rtl_kernel/rtl_vadd)
   example from Xilinx.
